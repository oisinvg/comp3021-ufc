# comp3021-ufc
### R project inspecting trends and relations in the UFC fights database with respect to fighter metrics, records, and divisional rankings.

From a Fundamentals of Information Visualisation (COMP3021) coursework; the task was to select any dataset and pose 8 questions the dataset could answer, and then answer them with data sources, visualisation, and reasoning. Known factors and variables are pondered upon ahead of sporting fixtures in an attempt to make predictions, so this report combs through some of the most common MMA biases.

1. Which fighter wins more, red or blue corner?
2. Does the weight class have an influence on the chance of KO?
3. How often does the older fighter beat the younger fighter?
4. Does having more wins than one's opponent lead to a better chance of winning?
5. Did a fighter's height and reach advantage (where present) have any correlation to outlanding their opponent?
6. What is the distribution of submission types?
7. How did the stances match up against each other?
8. Which has greater correlation to finishes - striking accuracy or takedown accuracy?
